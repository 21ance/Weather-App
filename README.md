# Project: Weather App

This is a Weather App, written using vanilla JavaScript. The project utilizes the free-tier API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). This allows the user to view the current weather, and three hour forecast of a specific city. There is also a search location feature with suggestions - made possible using OpenWeather's Geocoding API.
